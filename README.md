# Getting Started with Create React App

* After cloning the repo, cd to the `product-options` directory and run the command `yarn` to install dependencies

* Run `yarn start` to run the project

* Go to the `http://localhost:3000/configure-product` page to go to the configuration page for the product.

* Change the various config values and click on `Add Item To Cart` to add multiple products to the cart.

* Click on `Go to checkout` button to go the checkout page where we can view the list of items added to the card along with the total price info.

* Run `yarn test` to run unit tests

# Things that could have done differently if i have more time

* Separate the UI logic and the business logic from the `ProductConfigurator` component

* Add few more unit tests

* Add more error handling scenarios

* Add loading indicators to simulate making network requests

* Add some defence mechanisms when the user tries to access route directly rather than going through the flow of the project.
